App Description..well basically this app is for the movies lovers and movie fans..what you do is type movie in the search menu and the title of the movies shows up with the information about the movies,ratings,actors,,etc..
so the type of html we used was semantic ui for the search menu which was kinda hard at first because we are use to bootstrap but after watching videos and practice we learned the basics to create the homepage
some of the problems that we faced was trying to center the images after you search for them.and getting the API to work
so when you type the movie in it gives you the information and ratings about the movie and it also gives you a link to where you can watch the trailer to see if the movie is worth watching or not
